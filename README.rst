 * Detecting default managers
 * Nullable CharFields
 * Fields that are nullable but not blank (and vice versa?)
 * Ordering of model methods
 * Determining whether you have a poor code/applications ratio.
 * Number of models in a file.
 * Oldforms (?)

settings module:
 * Ordering of MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
 * TEMPLATE_DIRS not absolute
 * No MANAGERS or ADMINS
 * MANAGERS or ADMINS is string instead of iterable.
